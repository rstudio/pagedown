Paginate the HTML Output of R Markdown with CSS for Print. You only need a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) to generate PDF. No need to install LaTeX to get beautiful PDFs.

This R package stands on the shoulders of two giants to support typesetting with CSS for R Markdown documents: [Paged.js](https://gitlab.pagedmedia.org/tools/pagedjs) and [ReLaXed](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed) (we only borrowed some CSS from the ReLaXed repo and didn't really use the Node package).

You may install this package from Github:

```r
remotes::install_github('rstudio/pagedown')
```

This package requires a recent version of Pandoc (>= 2.2.3). If you use RStudio, you are recommended to install the [latest version](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (>= 1.2.1335), which has bundled Pandoc 2.x, otherwise you need to install Pandoc separately.

Below are some existing R Markdown output formats and examples.

## Paged HTML documents (`pagedown::html_paged`)

You can find [the full list of contributors of **pagedown** here](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/graphs/contributors). We always welcome new contributions. In particular, if you are familiar with CSS, we'd love to include your contributions of more creative and beautiful CSS stylesheets in this package. It is also very helpful if you don't know CSS but just tell us the creative and beautiful web pages you have seen, since other CSS experts may be able to port them into **pagedown**.
