# A Minimal Thesis Template {.chapter}

Please refer to [pagedown::html_thesis](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) to see a full example of how the thesis template can be utilized. For example it shows how to us a seperate `.Rmd` file for each chapter of your thesis so you can focus on them individually.

This template was created by [Brent Thorne](https://github.com/brentthorne) and was inspired by his inability to cope with writting a master's thesis in MS Word.
