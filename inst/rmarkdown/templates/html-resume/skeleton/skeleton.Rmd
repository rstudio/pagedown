    content: |
      Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I'm really looking for a PhD
      student position at the moment. I made this resume because Yihui asked me
      if I'd like to test the **pagedown** package with my resume. If you are
      interested in my background and skills, please feel free to contact me.
