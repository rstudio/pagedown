  volume = {20},
  issn = {1365-2486},
  abstract = {High-latitude ecosystems store approximately 1700~Pg of soil carbon (C), which is twice as much C as is currently contained in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of permafrost organic matter could add large amounts of C to the atmosphere, thereby influencing the global C cycle. The rates at which C is being released from the permafrost zone at different soil depths and across different physiographic regions are poorly understood but crucial in understanding future changes in permafrost C storage with climate change. We assessed the inherent decomposability of C from the permafrost zone by assembling a database of long-term ({$>$}1~year) aerobic soil incubations from 121 individual samples from 23 high-latitude ecosystems located across the northern circumpolar permafrost zone. Using a three-pool (i.e., fast, slow and passive) decomposition model, we estimated pool sizes for C fractions with different turnover times and their inherent decomposition rates using a reference temperature of 5~\textdegree{}C. Fast cycling C accounted for less than 5\% of all C in both organic and mineral soils whereas the pool size of slow cycling C increased with C~:~N. Turnover time at 5~\textdegree{}C of fast cycling C typically was below 1~year, between 5 and 15~years for slow turning over C, and more than 500~years for passive C. We project that between 20 and 90\% of the organic C could potentially be mineralized to CO2 within 50 incubation years at a constant temperature of 5~\textdegree{}C, with vulnerability to loss increasing in soils with higher C~:~N. These results demonstrate the variation in the vulnerability of C stored in permafrost soils based on inherent differences in organic matter decomposability, and point toward C~:~N as an index of decomposability that has the potential to be used to scale permafrost C loss across landscapes.},

  volume = {50},
  issn = {1944-7973},
  abstract = {Landscape attributes that vary with microtopography, such as active layer thickness (ALT), are labor intensive and difficult to document effectively through in situ methods at kilometer spatial extents, thus rendering remotely sensed methods desirable. Spatially explicit estimates of ALT can provide critically needed data for parameterization, initialization, and evaluation of Arctic terrestrial models. In this work, we demonstrate a new approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data for estimating centimeter-scale ALT in a 5 km2 area of ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. We use a simple regression-based, machine learning data-fusion algorithm that uses topographic and spectral metrics derived from multisensor data (LiDAR and WorldView-2) to estimate ALT (2 m spatial resolution) across the study area. Comparison of the ALT estimates with ground-based measurements, indicates the accuracy (r2\,=\,0.76, RMSE {$\pm$}4.4 cm) of the approach. While it is generally accepted that broad climatic variability associated with increasing air temperature will govern the regional averages of ALT, consistent with prior studies, our findings using high-resolution LiDAR and WorldView-2 data, show that smaller-scale variability in ALT is controlled by local eco-hydro-geomorphic factors. This work demonstrates a path forward for mapping ALT at high spatial resolution and across sufficiently large regions for improved understanding and predictions of coupled dynamics among permafrost, hydrology, and land-surface processes from readily available remote sensing data.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Arctic and sub-arctic watersheds are undergoing significant changes due to recent climate warming and degrading permafrost, engendering enhanced monitoring of arctic rivers. Smaller catchments provide understanding of discharge, solute flux and groundwater recharge at the process level that contributes to an understanding of how larger arctic watersheds are responding to climate change. The North Klondike River, located in west central Yukon, is a sub-alpine permafrost catchment, which maintains an active hydrological monitoring station with a record of {$>$}40 years. In addition to being able to monitor intra-annual variability, this data set allows for more complex analysis of streamflow records. Streamflow data, geochemistry and stable isotope data for 2014 show a groundwater-dominated system, predominantly recharged during periods of snowmelt. Radiocarbon is shown to be a valuable tracer of soil zone recharge processes and carbon sources. Winter groundwater baseflow contributes 20\hspace{0.25em}\% of total annual discharge, and accounts for up to 50\hspace{0.25em}\% of total river discharge during the spring and summer months. Although total stream discharge remains unchanged, mean annual groundwater baseflow has increased over the 40-year monitoring period. Wavelet analysis reveals a catchment that responds to El Ni\~no and longer solar cycles, as well as climatic shifts such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

  volume = {46},
  issn = {0165-0009},
  abstract = {Studies from a variety of disciplines document recent change in the northern high-latitude environment. Prompted by predictions of an amplified response of the Arctic to enhanced greenhouse forcing, we present a synthesis of these observations. Pronounced winter and spring warming over northern continents since about 1970 is partly compensated by cooling over the northern North Atlantic. Warming is also evident over the central Arctic Ocean. There is a downward tendency in sea ice extent, attended by warming and increased areal extent of the Arctic Ocean's Atlantic layer. Negative snow cover anomalies have dominated over both continents since the late 1980s and terrestrial precipitation has increased since 1900. Small Arctic glaciers have exhibited generally negative mass balances. While permafrost has warmed in Alaska and Russia, it has cooled in eastern Canada. There is evidence of increased plant growth, attended by greater shrub abundance and northward migration of the tree line. Evidence also suggests that the tundra has changed from a net sink to a net source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Taken together, these results paint a reasonably coherent picture of change, but their interpretation as signals of enhanced greenhouse warming is open to debate. Many of the environmental records are either short, are of uncertain quality, or provide limited spatial coverage. The recent high-latitude warming is also no larger than the interdecadal temperature range during this century. Nevertheless, the general patterns of change broadly agree with model predictions. Roughly half of the pronounced recent rise in Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures reflects shifts in atmospheric circulation. However, such changes are not inconsistent with anthropogenic forcing and include generally positive phases of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations and extratropical responses to the El-Ni\~no Southern Oscillation. An anthropogenic effect is also suggested from interpretation of the paleoclimate record, which indicates that the 20th century Arctic is the warmest of the past 400 years.},

  abstract = {Changes in active layer thickness (ALT) over northern high-latitude permafrost regions have important impacts on the surface energy balance, hydrologic cycle, carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface, plant growth, and ecosystems as a whole. This study examines the 20th century variations of ALT for the Ob, Yenisey, and Lena River basins. ALT is estimated from historical soil temperature measurements from 17 stations (1956\textendash{}1990, Lena basin only), an annual thawing index based on both surface air temperature data (1901\textendash{}2002) and numerical modeling (1980\textendash{}2002). The latter two provide spatial fields. Based on the thawing index, the long-term average (1961\textendash{}1990) ALT is about 1.87 m in the Ob, 1.67 in the Yenisey, and 1.69 m in the Lena basin. Over the past several decades, ALT over the three basins shows positive trends, but with different magnitudes. Based on the 17 stations, ALT increased about 0.32 m between 1956 and 1990 in the Lena. To the extent that results based on the soil temperatures represent ground ``truth,'' ALT obtained from both the thawing index and numerical modeling is underestimated. It is widely believed that ALT will increase with global warming. However, this hypothesis needs further refinement since ALT responds primarily to summer air temperature while observed warming has occurred mainly in winter and spring. It is also shown that ALT exhibits complex and inconsistent responses to variations in snow cover.},

  issn = {2169-8961},
  abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that lake-dominated ecosystems at high latitudes are undergoing significant hydrological changes. Research examining these changes is complicated because both thermokarst and climatic processes likely influence lake dynamics. To examine the relative impacts of these processes in permafrost landscapes, we investigated the dynamics of lake area and number in Old Crow Flats (OCF), Yukon using historical air photos and satellite imagery. Between 1951 and 2007, OCF experienced a decline of \textasciitilde{}6000\,ha in total lake area but gained 232 lakes. Close to half (49\%) of the difference in lake area was driven by the rapid and persistent drainage of 38 large lakes. These catastrophic drainages were associated with new or enlarged outlet channels, resulted in the formation of numerous residual ponds, and were likely driven by thermokarst processes. Our analysis shows that catastrophic lake drainages have become more than 5 times more frequent in recent decades. These changes are likely related to the impacts of increased temperature and precipitation on thermokarst processes. Fifty-nine of the 170 intensively studied lakes showed either large bidirectional fluctuations or gradual cumulative declines. These changes affected a much smaller portion of OCF and were likely driven by interactions between increased precipitation and temperature and individual catchment characteristics. To anticipate landscape-scale changes in these systems, and assess their impact on hydrology, wildlife habitat, and carbon storage, field research is required to better characterize the mechanisms responsible for changes.},

  title = {Isotopic Evidence for Recent Hydrological Shifts in Source Waters of Shallow Lakes in Northern Freshwater Landscapes.},
  abstract = {In northern Canada, shallow-lake-rich freshwater landscapes provide key habitat for many wildlife species and play a vital role in the traditional use of the land by local indigenous communities. Changes in precipitation have the potential to substantially alter the hydrological conditions of these shallow lakes. Here we compare multiple years of measurements of lake water oxygen isotope composition ({$\delta$}18Omes) with surface sediment cellulose-inferred lake water oxygen isotope composition ({$\delta$}18Oinf) for \textasciitilde{}80 lakes in two of Canada's largest lake-rich thermokarst landscapes \textendash{} Old Crow Flats (OCF), Yukon, and western Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Manitoba. Results reveal a strikingly coherent pattern of recent hydrological change in these two landscapes. In OCF, {$\delta$}18Oinf values from snowmelt-dominated lakes align reasonably well with the 2007-2008 {$\delta$}18Omes values from the early ice-free season, as expected. In contrast, {$\delta$}18Oinf from rainfall-dominated lakes are systematically lower (i.e., more 18O-depleted) relative to {$\delta$}18Omes. Climate data indicate that the winter of 2007-08 had markedly lower snowfall compared to the long-term mean, whereas winters immediately prior to our water sample collections were characterized by snowfall equal to or greater than the long-term mean. Thus, we speculate that the isotopic offset between {$\delta$}18Oinf and {$\delta$}18Omes for some of the lakes is due to a shift to more rainfall-dominated precipitation. Similar results have been obtained from lakes in HBL. Here too, about 40\% of the sampled lakes contain {$\delta$}18Oinf values that are lower than {$\delta$}18Omes values from 2010-2012, which may also reflect a recent shift to more rainfall-dominated precipitation. These findings suggest that some lakes in our study areas received less snowmelt during the water sampling years in comparison to the time interval captured in the surface-sediments. Notably, a few lakes in HBL lost all of their water to evaporation during mid-summer 2010, fuelling concerns that reduction in snowmelt and an increase in the length of the ice-free season in these landscapes may lead to an increase in the occurrence of lake desiccation.},

  abstract = {To improve understanding and prediction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and fluxes in northern peat-dominated catchments, we present the development and application of a parsimonious tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model coupled with a biogeochemistry subroutine able to concurrently simulate streamflow and DOC dynamics. The modeling approach which included quantitative assessment of associated uncertainties was conditioned by geochemical tracers which discriminate dominant water sources. Integration of DOC was predicated on statistical time series models which identified air temperature and streamflow as the key proxies that capture DOC supply and transport processes in two upland catchments in Scotland, UK. Conceptualizing the nonlinear partitioning of quick near-surface and slower groundwater runoff sources in combination with a DOC mass balance resulted in a coupled, low-parameter mechanistic model. Model tests showed mostly sensitive parameters and reasonable simulation results with seasonally controlled DOC supply and event-based DOC transport. Transport is facilitated even for smaller events by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff ``switches off'' and stream DOC is dominated by low concentration groundwaters. Furthermore, the model was able to explain subtle differences in DOC dynamics between the two catchments mainly reflecting the distribution of saturated soils and available storage. We conclude that tracers and statistical time series models can successfully guide the development of parsimonious yet structurally consistent water quality models. Parsimonious models provide tools for estimating DOC dynamics and loads with reduced uncertainty and potentially greater transferability.},

  abstract = {Climate change is causing extensive warming across Arctic regions resulting in permafrost degradation, alterations to regional hydrology and shifting amounts and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) transported by streams and rivers. Here, we characterize the DOM composition and optical properties of the six largest Arctic rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean to examine the ability of optical measurements to provide meaningful insights into terrigenous carbon export patterns and biogeochemical cycling. The chemical composition of aquatic DOM varied with season, spring months were typified by highest lignin phenol and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with greater hydrophobic acid content, and lower proportions of hydrophilic compounds, relative to summer and winter months. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) spectral slope (S275\textendash{}295) tracked seasonal shifts in DOM composition across river basins. Fluorescence and parallel factor analysis identified seven components across the six Arctic rivers. The ratios of ``terrestrial humic-like'' vs. ``marine humic-like'' fluorescent components co-varied with lignin monomer ratios over summer and winter months, suggesting fluorescence may provide information on the age and degradation state of riverine DOM. CDOM absorbance (a350) proved a sensitive proxy for lignin phenol concentrations across all six river basins and over the hydrograph, enabling for the first time the development of a single pan-arctic relationship between a350 and terrigenous DOC (R2 = 0.93). Combining this lignin proxy with high-resolution monitoring of a350, pan-arctic estimates of annual lignin flux were calculated to range from 156 to 185 Gg, resulting in shorter and more constrained estimates of terrigenous DOM residence times in the Arctic Ocean (spanning 7 months to 2\textonehalf{} years). Furthermore, multiple linear regression models incorporating both absorbance and fluorescence variables proved capable of explaining much of the variability in lignin composition across rivers and seasons. Our findings suggest that synoptic, high-resolution optical measurements can provide improved understanding of northern high-latitude organic matter cycling and flux, and prove an important technique for capturing future climate-driven changes.},

  abstract = {As the permafrost region warms, its large organic carbon pool will be increasingly vulnerable to decomposition, combustion, and hydrologic export. Models predict that some portion of this release will be offset by increased production of Arctic and boreal biomass; however, the lack of robust estimates of net carbon balance increases the risk of further overshooting international emissions targets. Precise empirical or model-based assessments of the critical factors driving carbon balance are unlikely in the near future, so to address this gap, we present estimates from 98 permafrost-region experts of the response of biomass, wildfire, and hydrologic carbon flux to climate change. Results suggest that contrary to model projections, total permafrost-region biomass could decrease due to water stress and disturbance, factors that are not adequately incorporated in current models. Assessments indicate that end-of-the-century organic carbon release from Arctic rivers and collapsing coastlines could increase by 75\% while carbon loss via burning could increase four-fold. Experts identified water balance, shifts in vegetation community, and permafrost degradation as the key sources of uncertainty in predicting future system response. In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario but that 65\%\textendash{}85\% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.},

  abstract = {Many northern lake-rich regions are undergoing pronounced hydrological change, yet inadequate knowledge of the drivers of these landscape-scale responses hampers our ability to predict future conditions. We address this challenge in the thermokarst landscape of Old Crow Flats (OCF) using a combination of remote sensing imagery and monitoring of stable isotope compositions of lake waters over three thaw seasons (2007\textendash{}2009). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the hydrological behavior of lakes is strongly influenced by catchment vegetation and physiography. Catchments of snowmelt-dominated lakes, typically located in southern peripheral areas of OCF, encompass high proportions of woodland/forest and tall shrub vegetation (mean percent land cover = ca. 60\%). These land cover types effectively capture snow and generate abundant snowmelt runoff that offsets lake water evaporation. Rainfalldominated lakes that are not strongly influenced by evaporation are typically located in eastern and northern OCF where their catchments have higher proportions of dwarf shrub/herbaceous and sparse vegetation (ca. 45\%), as well as surface water (ca. 20\%). Evaporation-dominated lakes, are located in the OCF interior where their catchments are distinguished by substantially higher lake area to catchment area ratios (LA/CA = ca. 29\%) compared to low evaporation-influenced rainfall-dominated (ca. 10\%) and snowmelt-dominated (ca. 4\%) lakes. Lakes whose catchments contain {$>$}75\% combined dwarf shrub/herbaceous vegetation and surface water are most susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown, especially following periods of low precipitation. Findings indicate that multiple hydrological trajectories are probable in response to climate-driven changes in precipitation amount and seasonality, vegetation composition, and thermokarst processes. These will likely include a shift to greater snowmelt influence in catchments experiencing expansion of tall shrubs, greater influence from evaporation in catchments having higher proportions of surface water, and an increase in the rate of thermokarst lake expansion and probability of drainage. Local observations suggest that some of these changes are already underway.},

  volume = {9},

  abstract = {Tools that can monitor biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants are needed to understand how arctic herbivores may respond to the rapidly changing environment at high latitudes. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used to assess changes in abundance and distribution of terrestrial vegetative communities. However, the efficacy of NDVI to measure seasonal changes in biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants in the Arctic remains largely un-evaluated at landscape and fine-scale levels. We modeled the relationships between NDVI and seasonal changes in aboveground biomass and nitrogen concentration in halophytic graminoids, a key food source for arctic-nesting geese. The model was calibrated based on data collected at one site and validated using data from another site. Effects of spatial scale on model accuracy were determined by comparing model predictions between NDVI derived from moderate resolution (250 \texttimes{} 250 m pixels) satellite data and high resolution (20 cm diameter area) handheld spectrometer data. NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer was a superior estimator (R2 {$\geq$} 0.67) of seasonal changes in aboveground biomass compared to satellite-derived NDVI (R2 {$\leq$} 0.40). The addition of temperature and precipitation variables to the model for biomass improved fit, but provided minor gains in predictive power beyond that of the NDVI-only model. This model, however, was only a moderately accurate estimator of biomass in an ecologically-similar halophytic graminoid wetland located 100 km away, indicating the necessity for site-specific validation. In contrast to assessments of biomass, satellite-derived NDVI was a better estimator for the timing of peak percent of nitrogen than NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer. We confirmed that the date when NDVI reached 50\% of its seasonal maximum was a reasonable approximation of the period of peak spring vegetative green-up and peak percent nitrogen. This study demonstrates the importance of matching the scale of NDVI measurements to the vegetation properties of biomass and nitrogen phenology.},

  abstract = {Recent northern vegetation changes caused by climate warming have been well documented, using experimental plot warming to examine vegetation-specific changes and satellite image data to examine overall trends. Previous remote sensing efforts have employed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from AVHRR, whose 1 km to 8 km pixel size is too large for examination of broad scale vegetation-specific responses because of mixing within the pixel footprint. In this paper, we reconcile differences between field- and remote sensing-based approaches by using both medium-resolution (30 m) and coarseresolution (1 km) data to study 20 years of vegetation-specific responses to northern climate warming (1986 to 2006). Trends are compared among vegetation communities from two separate Landsat classifications in Canada's eastern and western forest-tundra transition zone, as well as a 1 km AVHRR database recently developed over Canada. A comparison of absolute trends among mapped vegetation communities revealed lichen-dominated communities consistently exhibiting lower trends than those dominated by vascular plants, with both exhibiting increasing NDVI. Our results and those obtained from experimental warming suggest that the magnitude difference in NDVI increase between lichen and vascular vegetation is related to increasing vigor and biomass of vascular vegetation, in contrast to physiological impairment of lichen due to the short-term secondary effect of temperature on moisture. In the longer term, succession from lichen to vascular is likely responsible for the small observed NDVI increase over lichen-dominated regions. The fact that both Landsat and AVHRR exhibited similar relative vegetation-specific trends in NDVI suggests that this phenomenon may be widespread in the North.},

To do this, we utilize monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data from 2002 to 2016. Together with global land reanalysis, and river runoff data, we identify declining TWS trends throughout the ACTR that we attribute largely to increasing evapotranspiration driven by increasing summer air temperatures. In terms of regional changes, large and significant negative trends in TWS are observed mainly over the North American continent. At basin scale, we show that, in the Lena River basin, the autumnal TWS signal persists until the spring of the following year, while in the Mackenzie River basin, the TWS level in the autumn and winter has no significant impact on the following year. As expected global warming is expected to be particularly significant in the northern regions, our results are important for understanding future TWS trends, with possible further decline.},

  abstract = {Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Compared with the other earlier Landsat satellites, Landsat 8 has several new characteristics in spectral bands, spectral range and radiometric resolution. Therefore, there is a strong requirement to analyze the characteristics of the Landsat 8 for land cover classification, global change research. In this paper, Landsat 8 OLI image was used with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) for land cover classification. Firstly, the Top of Atmospheric (TOA) reflectance based TCT was developed based on Landsat 8 OLI images. Then comparison of ISODATA, K-Means and SVM of all original 8 Landsat 8 OLI bands and both of TCT Greenness and Wetness in land cover classification was done. The present results showed that compared with using the original 8 Landsat 8 OLI bands, the classification results from ISODATA and K-Means based on both of TCT Greenness and Wetness had better robustness and accuracy, and the classification using SVM with TCT had better efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Orbital imaging spectrometers, such as the proposed Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide global, multi-year Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) reflectance maps. Monitoring the Earth's surface at high spectral resolution will advance our understanding of changing ecosystems and land use. These applications depend on reliable correction of atmospheric scattering and absorption. The HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign is an airborne precursor mission comprised of multiple flights by the ``classic'' Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) over a wide geographic area. This article describes the atmospheric correction that we have implemented for the campaign. We first present the theoretical basis of our approach, which is grounded in the ATmospheric REMoval (ATREM) algorithm. We then describe new enhancements including retrieval of pressure altitude, which improves accuracy over widely varying topography, and joint retrieval of optical absorption for three phases of water (vapor, liquid, and ice), which improves accuracy over vegetated areas. Reflectance is validated using ground spectra acquired across a wide range of targets and elevations. Finally, we use the algorithm to map vapor, liquid, and ice phases of water over 6 months across a 14,000 km2 region of California. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The accumulated dataset of paleo\textendash{}groundwater-level markers ({$>$} 300 index points) has a dense spatial and temporal coverage and a predictive quality that enables geostatistical analysis.

  abstract = {Understanding spatial variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in three-dimensional direction is helpful for land use management. Due to the effect of profile depths and soil texture on vertical distribution of SOC, the stationary assumption for SOC cannot be met in the vertical direction. Therefore the three-dimensional (3D) ordinary kriging technique cannot be directly used to map the distribution of SOC at a regional scale. The objectives of this study were to map the 3D distribution of SOC at a regional scale by combining kriging method with the profile depth function of SOC (KPDF), and to explore the effects of soil texture and land use type on vertical distribution of SOC in a fluvial plain. A total of 605 samples were collected from 121 soil profiles (0.0 to 1.0 m, 0.20 m increment) in Quzhou County, China and SOC contents were determined for each soil sample. The KPDF method was used to obtain the 3D map of SOC at the county scale. The results showed that the exponential equation well described the vertical distribution of mean values of the SOC contents. The coefficients of determination, root mean squared error and mean prediction error between the measured and the predicted SOC contents were 0.52, 1.82 and -0.24 g kg-1 respectively, suggesting that the KPDF method could be used to produce a 3D map of SOC content. The surface SOC contents were high in the mid-west and south regions, and low values lay in the southeast corner. The SOC contents showed significant positive correlations between the five different depths and the correlations of SOC contents were larger in adjacent layers than in non-adjacent layers. Soil texture and land use type had significant effects on the spatial distribution of SOC. The influence of land use type was more important than that of soil texture in the surface soil, and soil texture played a more important role in influencing the SOC levels for 0.2-0.4 m layer.},

Here, we show that phase changes in the AO/NAO are recorded in the isotopic (d18O and D-carbon isotope discrimination) characteristics of the long-lived circum-arctic plant, Cassiope tetragona, as summer rain has become a more important water source than snowmelt water which in turn has lead to decreases in D and reductions in plant stem growth. These isotopic records in C. tetragona may facilitate reconstructions of climate, plant\textendash{}soil water relations, plant gas exchange attributes and a mechanistic understanding of growth responses to shifts in atmospheric circulation. If plant specimens were available for populations across the arctic as part of the International Polar Year, these archives could provide a circum-arctic record of historical climate change and associated shifts in physiological plant performance and growth.},

  abstract = {We investigated the tree growth and physiological response of five pine forest stands in relation to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration (ca) and climate in the Iberian Peninsula using annually resolved width and d13C treering chronologies since AD 1600. 13C discrimination (D \% ci/ca), leaf intercellular CO2 concentration (ci) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) were inferred from d13C values. The most pronounced changes were observed during the second half of the 20th century, and differed between stands. Three sites kept a constant ci/ca ratio, leading to significant ci and iWUE increases (active response to ca); whereas a significant increase in ci/ca resulted in the lowest iWUE increase of all stands at a relict Pinus uncinata forest site (passive response to ca). A significant decrease in ci/ca led to the greatest iWUE improvement at the northwestern site. We tested the climatic signal strength registered in the d13C series after removing the low-frequency trends due to the physiological responses to increasing ca. We found stronger correlations with temperature during the growing season, demonstrating that the physiological response to ca changes modulated d13C and masked the climate signal. Since 1970 higher d13C values revealed iWUE improvements at all the sites exceeding values expected by an active response to the ca increase alone. These patterns were related to upward trends in temperatures, indicating that other factors are reinforcing stomatal closure in these forests. Narrower rings during the second half of the 20th century than in previous centuries were observed at four sites and after 1970 at all sites, providing no evidence for a possible CO2 `fertilization' effect on growth. The iWUE improvements found for all the forests, reflecting both a ca rise and warmer conditions, seem to be insufficient to compensate for the negative effects of the increasing water limitation on growth.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of spring break-up flooding in the Slave River Delta (SRD), Northwest Territories, are characterized during three years (2003\textendash{}2005) using water isotope tracers and total inorganic suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations measured from lakewater samples collected shortly after the spring melt. Strongly contrasting spring melt periods led to a moderate flood in 2003, no flooding in 2004 and widespread flooding in 2005. Flooded lakes have isotopically-depleted {$\upsilon$}18O ({$\upsilon$}2H) signatures, ranging between 19\DH{}2\textperthousand{} ( 145\textperthousand{}) and 17\DH{}1\textperthousand{} ( 146\textperthousand{}) and most have high TSS concentrations ({$>$}10 mg L 1), while non-flooded lakes have more isotopically-enriched {$\upsilon$}18O ({$\upsilon$}2H) signatures, ranging between 18\DH{}2\textperthousand{} ( 149\textperthousand{}) and 10\DH{}6\textperthousand{} ( 118\textperthousand{}) and low TSS concentrations ({$<$}10 mg L 1). These results, in conjunction with the isotopic signatures of Slave River water and snowmelt, are used to estimate the proportion of river- or snowmelt-induced dilution in delta lakes during the spring of each study year. Calculations indicate river flooding caused dilution of \textthreequarters{}70\textendash{}100\% in delta lakes, while snowmelt dilution in the absence of river flooding ranged from \textthreequarters{}0\textendash{}56\%. A positive relationship exists between the spatial extent of spring flooding in the SRD and level and discharge on the Slave River and upstream tributaries, suggesting that upstream flow generation plays a key role in determining the magnitude of spring flooding in the SRD. Parallel variations in the 46-year instrumental Slave River discharge record and flood stratigraphy in the active delta indicate that there is potential for extending the flood history of the SRD, a development that will contribute to a more robust understanding of the drivers of historic, contemporary and future flood frequency in the delta.

Isotopic compositions of input water (?I) and evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios, calculated using the coupled-isotope tracer method, provide key hydrological metrics for each lake over the 5-year sampling interval. From these time series, we identify monitoring lakes that are sensitive to changes in snowmelt, rainfall, and evaporation, and demonstrate the use of the Mann-Kendall test for determining statistically significant trends in the roles of these hydrological processes on lake-water balances. These approaches will serve to identify lake hydrological responses to climate change and variability from ongoing water isotope monitoring by Parks Canada, in partnership with the Vuntut Gwitchin Government, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Waterloo.},

  volume = {95},
  issn = {1365-2745},
  abstract = {* 1The arctic environment is highly heterogeneous in terms of plant distribution and productivity. If we are to make regional scale predictions of carbon exchange it is necessary to find robust relationships that can simplify this variability. One such potential relationship is that of leaf area to photosynthetic CO2 flux at the canopy scale.
* 2In this paper we assess the effectiveness of canopy leaf area in explaining variation in gross primary productivity (GPP): (i) across different vegetation types; (ii) at various stages of leaf development; and (iii) under enhanced nutrient availability. To do this we measure net CO2 flux light response curves with a 1~\texttimes{}~1~m chamber, and calculate GPP at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 600~{$\mathrm{\mu}$}mol~m-2~s-1.
* 3At a subarctic site in Sweden, we report 10-fold variation in GPP among natural vegetation types with leaf area index (LAI) values of 0.05\textendash{}2.31~m2~m-2. At a site of similar latitude in Alaska we document substantially elevated rates of GPP in fertilized vegetation.
* 4We can explain 80\% of the observed variation in GPP in natural vegetation (including vegetation measured before deciduous leaf bud burst) by leaf area alone, when leaf area is predicted from measurements of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).
* 5In fertilized vegetation the relative increase in leaf area between control and fertilized treatments exceeds the relative increase in GPP. This suggests that higher leaf area causes increased self-shading, or that lower leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area causes a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis.
* 6The results of this study indicate that canopy leaf area is an excellent predictor of GPP in diverse low arctic tundra, across a wide range of plant functional types.},

  abstract = {We conducted measurements of methane (CH4) emission and ecosystem respiration on {$>$}200 points across the Arctic coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska, United States, in July 2007 and August 2008. This site contains broad diversity in tundra microtopography, including polygonal tundra, thaw lakes, and drained lake basins. In 2007, we surveyed CH4 emissions across this landscape, and found that soil water content was the strongest control of methane emission rate, such that emission rates rose exponentially with water content. However, there was considerable residual variation in CH4 emission in the wettest soils ({$>$}80\% volumetric water content) where CH4 emissions were highest. A statistical analysis of possible soil and plant controls on CH4 emission rates from these wet soils revealed that vegetation height (especially of Carex aquatilis) was the best predictor, with ecosystem respiration and permafrost depth as significant copredictors. To evaluate whether plant height served as a proxy for aboveground plant biomass, or gross primary production, we conducted a survey of CH4 emission rates from wet, Carex-dominated sites in 2008, coincidently measuring these candidate predictors. Surprisingly, vegetation height remained the best predictor of CH4 emission rates, with CH4 emissions rising exponentially with vegetation height. We hypothesize that taller plants have more extensive root systems that both stimulate more methanogenesis and conduct more pore water CH4 to the atmosphere. We anticipate that the magnitude of the climate change\textendash{}CH4 feedback in the Arctic Coastal Plain will strongly depend on how permafrost thaw alters the ecology of Carex aquatilis.},

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {Abstract An atmospheric general circulation model with prescribed sea surface temperature and cloudiness was integrated for 50 years in order to study atmosphere-land surface interactions. The temporal variability of model soil moisture and precipitation have been studied in an effort to understand the interactions of these variables with other components of the climate system. Temporal variability analysis has shown that the spectra of monthly mean precipitation over land are close to white at all latitudes, with total variance decreasing poleward. In contrasts, the spectra of soil moisture are red, and become more red with increasing latitude. As a measure of this redness, half of the total variance of a composite tropical soil moisture spectrum occurs at periods longer than nine months, while at high latitudes, half of the total variance of a composite soil moisture spectrum occurs at periods longer than 22 months. The spectra of soil moisture also exhibit marked longitudinal variations. These spectral results may be viewed in the light of stochastic theory. The formulation of the GFDL soil moisture parameterization is mathematically similar to a stochastic process. According to this model, forcing of a system by an input white noise variable (precipitation) will yield an output variable (soil moisture) with a red spectrum, the redness of which is controlled by a damping term (potential evaporation). Thus, the increasingly red nature of the soil moisture spectra at higher latitudes is a result of declining potential evaporation values at higher latitudes. Physically, soil moisture excesses are dissipated more slowly at high latitudes where the energy available for evaporation is small. Some of the longitudinal variations in soil moisture spectra result from longitudinal variations in potential evaporation, while others are explicable in terms of the value of the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation. Regions where this value is less than one are characterized by frequent runoff and short time scales of soil moisture variability. By preventing excessive positive anomalies of soil moisture, the runoff process hastens the return of soil moisture values to their mean state, thereby shortening soil moisture time scales. Through the use of a second GCM integration with prescribed soil moisture, it was shown that interactive sod moisture may substantially increase summer surface air temperature variability. Soil moisture interacts with the atmosphere primarily through the surface energy balance. The degree of soil saturation strongly influences the atmosphere of outgoing energy from the surface between the latent and sensible heat fluxes. Interactive soil moisture allows larger variations of these fluxes, thereby increasing the variance of surface air temperature. Because the flux of latent heat is directly proportional to potential evaporation under conditions of sufficient moisture, the influence of soil moisture on the atmosphere is greatest when the potential evaporation value is large. This occurs most frequently in the tropics and summer hemisphere extratropics.},

  abstract = {Climate change is having major impacts on northern regions. Shrub vegetation proliferation is an example of how land cover is being modified, which can influence ground biophysical conditions and the hydrology of lake-rich landscapes. These impacts are being investigated in Old Crow Flats, Yukon, traditional territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation who rely on the resources of this landscape to support their traditional lifestyle. Vegetation conditions of two 90-m x 90-m plots were investigated using dendrochronology and high-resolution multi-spectral images captured using an unmanned aviation vehicle (UAV). Dendrochronology results showed that the average age for shrub vegetation was 28 years old (standard deviation = 13.65). The dominant species in the two plots included green alder (Alnus viridis,), dwarf birch (Betula nan), and willow (Salix sp.). Red and near-infrared bands of the multi-spectral images were used to calculate normalized difference vegetation index values (NDVI) for the two plots, which is an indicator of plant chlorophyll and phytomass. Vegetation characteristics measured on the ground were compared to NDVI values to identify whether NDVI may be used to differentiate species and plant age. Results of this research show that coupling UAV technology with ground measurements may be highly useful for identifying shrub species and age in lake-rich Arctic landscapes such as Old Crow Flats, Yukon. Integrated approaches being developed here are enhancing hydroecological monitoring protocols, which are providing the basis to identify how
this landscape is responding to a changing climate.},

It contains over 2500 thermokarst lakes, many of which have rectilinear shorelines and tend to be oriented either NE-SW or NW-SE. Previous explanations of the shape and orientation of the lakes focussed on the underlying geological structure and the propagation of faults through the sediments to cause the alignment of the lakeshores. Permafrost conditions and shore erosion mechanisms observed at forested and tundra sites suggest that wind and patterns of ice-wedge development may be contributing to the occurrence of rectilinear shorelines in the open tundra of Old Crow Flats.},

  abstract = {Orbital imaging spectrometers, such as the proposed Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide global, multi-year Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) reflectance maps. Monitoring the Earth's surface at high spectral resolution will advance our understanding of changing ecosystems and land use. These applications depend on reliable correction of atmospheric scattering and absorption. The HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign is an airborne precursor mission comprised of multiple flights by the ``classic'' Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) over a wide geographic area. This article describes the atmospheric correction that we have implemented for the campaign. We first present the theoretical basis of our approach, which is grounded in the ATmospheric REMoval (ATREM) algorithm. We then describe new enhancements including retrieval of pressure altitude, which improves accuracy over widely varying topography, and joint retrieval of optical absorption for three phases of water (vapor, liquid, and ice), which improves accuracy over vegetated areas. Reflectance is validated using ground spectra acquired across a wide range of targets and elevations. Finally, we use the algorithm to map vapor, liquid, and ice phases of water over 6 months across a 14,000 km2 region of California. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the former, percentage wetland cover in the watershed was positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP, r2 = 0.78, primarily bog), total nitrogen (TN, r2 = 0.50), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r2 = 0.74) concentrations. Rich fens appeared to sequester both TP and TN. In upland-dominated lakes, the ratio of catchment area to lake volume (CA/LV) was the strongest watershed correlate of TP concentration (r2 = 0.56), whereas most limnetic nitrogen and DOC were generated in situ. Colour concentration, being highest in wetland lakes, was correlated with the ratio of isotopically defined effective drainage basin area to lake volume (eDBA/LV, r2 = 0.63). Drainage basin slope was only weakly associated with water quality, likely because of low topographic relief (\textsterling{}11\%). Higher Chlorophyta and Peridineae biomasses in wetland-dominated systems than in upland-dominated ones may coincide with greater NH4+ availability.},

In the relatively deep headwater Lake B3, the indicator for all phytoplankton was not different after fire (p = 0.3), but important changes occurred in the phytoplankton community for 4 years after fire.

In the former, percentage wetland cover in the watershed was positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP, r2 = 0.78, primarily bog), total nitrogen (TN, r2 = 0.50), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, r2 = 0.74) concentrations. Rich fens appeared to sequester both TP and TN. In upland-dominated lakes, the ratio of catchment area to lake volume (CA/LV) was the strongest watershed correlate of TP concentration (r2 = 0.56), whereas most limnetic nitrogen and DOC were generated in situ. Colour concentration, being highest in wetland lakes, was correlated with the ratio of isotopically defined effective drainage basin area to lake volume (eDBA/LV, r2 = 0.63). Drainage basin slope was only weakly associated with water quality, likely because of low topographic relief (\textsterling{}11\%). Higher Chlorophyta and Peridineae biomasses in wetland-dominated systems than in upland-dominated ones may coincide with greater NH4+ availability.},

  abstract = {An overview of current research in isotope hydrology, focusing on recent Canadian contributions, is discussed under the headings: precipitation networks, hydrograph separation and groundwater studies, river basin hydrology, lake and catchment water balance, and isotope palaeohydrology from lake sediment records. Tracer-based techniques, relying primarily on the naturally occurring environmental isotopes, have been integrated into a range of hydrological and biogeochemical research programmes, as they effectively complement physical and chemical techniques. A significant geographic focus of Canadian isotope hydrology research has been on the Mackenzie River basin, forming contributions to programmes such as the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment. Canadian research has also directly supported international efforts such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation and IAEAs Coordinated Research Project on Large River Basins. One significant trend in Canadian research is toward sustained long-term monitoring of precipitation and river discharge to enable better characterization of spatial and temporal variability in isotope signatures and their underlying causes. One fundamental conclusion drawn from previous studies in Canada is that combined use of {$\upsilon$}18O and {$\upsilon$}2H enables the distinction of precipitation variability from evaporation effects, which offers significant advantages over use of the individual tracers alone. The study of hydrological controls on water chemistry is one emerging research trend that stems from the unique ability to integrate isotope sampling within both water quality and water quantity surveys.

  abstract = {Wildfires burn extensive forest areas around the world each year. In many locations, fire-prone forest catchments are utilised for the supply of potable water to small communities up to large cities. Following wildfire, increased erosion rates and changes to runoff generation and pollutant sources may greatly increase fluxes of sediment, nutrients and other water quality constituents, potentially contaminating water supplies. Most research to date has focused on suspended sediment exports and concentrations after wildfire. Reported first year post-fire suspended sediment exports varied from 0.017 to 50 t ha\`A1 year\`A1 across a large range of catchment sizes (0.021\textendash{}1655 km2). This represented an estimated increase of 1\textendash{}1459 times unburned exports. Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for the first year after fire ranged from 11 to \$500,000 mg L\`A1. Similarly, there was a large range in first year post-fire stream exports of total N (1.1\textendash{}27 kg ha\`A1 year\`A1) and total P (0.03\textendash{}3.2 kg ha\`A1 year\`A1), representing a multiple change of 0.3\textendash{}431 times unburned, while NO\`A3 exports of 0.04\textendash{}13.0 kg ha\`A1 year\`A1 (3\textendash{}250 times unburned) have been reported. NO\`A3 , NO\`A2 , and NH3/NH\th{}4 concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after wildfire but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding drinking water guidelines. Few studies have examined post-fire exports of trace elements. The limited observations of trace element concentrations in streams after wildfire found high levels (well over guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. Elevated Na+, Cl\`A and SO24\`A solute yields have been recorded soon after fire, while reports of concentrations of these constituents were mostly confined to coniferous forest areas in North America, where maximum sampled values were well below recommended limits. Likewise, reported wildfire effects on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor and elevated concentrations largely reflected background conditions. Available cyanide concentrations in small streams may approach levels of concern soon after fire, but increases are likely to be of short duration. Post-fire concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in streams have been found to increase but remained within the recommended limit. Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after wildfire indicate the potential for impacts on water supply from forest catchments. In response, various water treatment measures may be required and in the absence of adequate treatment facilities or alternative sources, water supplies may be vulnerable to disruption.},

The change in water export between pre(1983) and post-fire (1998 to 2000) periods was higher in the burned (4th order) than reference stream (3rd order) (P = 0.01). Burned to reference stream ratios of particulate P (PP) flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMC) and export were 1.5 and 2.8, respectively, in year 1 and 2.8 and 6.7, respectively, in year 2 post-fire. Particulate P comprised a similar proportion of total P export in the burned stream before fire and in the reference stream (65\%), but a higher proportion after fire during the peakflow season only (77\%) (P {$<$} 0.02). Phosphorus concentration and discharge (Q) were positively related in both streams, across all Q intensities measured in the case of dissolved P, but only at Q {$>$} 1.5 m3 s-1 for PP. Changes in P export after fire were evident during peakflow and were largely restricted to the PP fraction. These changes appear to be driven by higher discharge, which enhanced loading of P-rich particulates from the watershed and (or) from the stream channel.},

Wapusk National Park is representative of the Hudson Bay Lowlands and small lakes and ponds make up a considerable component of the landscape. The Hudson Bay Lowlands have experienced relatively recent isostatic rebound from submarine conditions, hence proximity to the coast was found to be a major factor in determining the concentration of dissolved salts in pond water. It was observed that the ionic composition of the water in ponds throughout much of the park is consistent, indicating that most of the ponds are an expression of surface water maintaining little connection to groundwater. The prevalence of permafrost throughout much of the park is likely the reason for this stability. Ponds within the park also show considerable variability in the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) they contain. DOC shows a strong north-south and east-west trend. Ponds in the northeast of the park have lower DOC values while ponds in the southwest of the park have higher levels of DOC. Changes in DOC within the park appear to be driven by changes in the terrestrial vegetation surrounding the ponds.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the cause(s) of declines in total phosphorus (TP) observed over the past three decades across many forested catchments in central Ontario remains a research priority. The objectives of this paper were firstly to test the assumption that weir water chemistry is representative of catchment changes at two adjacent headwater streams that have shown declines in TP and secondly use long-term measurements of weir water quality (1980\textendash{}2008) to identify potential drivers of TP declines. Longitudinal measurements confirmed that weir water chemistry is generally representative of the entire stream channel, although channel-associated wetlands have a strong influence on TP. Additionally, processes operating in wetlands dictate seasonal patterns in TP, and differences in wetland cover explain the approximately twofold difference in average TP between the two catchments. Changes in wetland cover or processes, however, cannot explain declines in TP. Rather, declines in TP are most coherent with declines in stream potassium (K) and nitrate (NO3-N), which also occurred over the past 30 years. We suggest that coincident declines in TP, NO3-N, and K may be best explained by recovery from a disturbance event.},

  abstract = {Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have declined in many lakes and streams across south-central Ontario, Canada, over the past three decades, and changes have been most pronounced in wetland-dominated catchments. In this study, longterm (1980\textendash{}2007) patterns in TP concentrations in streams were assessed at four wetland-dominated catchments that drain into Dickie Lake (DE) in south-central Ontario. Two of the subcatchments (DE5 and DE6) have particularly large wetland components (31\%\textendash{}34\% of catchment area), and these wetlands are characterized by numerous standing dead trees and many young live trees (18\textendash{}27 years old). These two streams exhibited large peaks in TP and potassium (K) export in the early 1980s. In contrast, TP and K export from DE8 and DE10 (wetland cover 19\%\textendash{}20\%) were relatively flat over the entire record (1980\textendash{}2007), and field surveys indicated negligible standing dead biomass in these wetlands and a relatively healthy, mixed-age tree community. The coincidence of high TP and K concentrations in the DE5 and DE6 streams as well as evidence of a disturbance event in their wetlands during the early 1980s suggest that disturbance events (e.g., flooding) that lead to wetland tree mortality may contribute to patterns in surface water TP observed in this region.},

  abstract = {In the Alaskan Arctic, rapid climate change is increasing the frequency of disturbance including wildfire and permafrost collapse. These pulse disturbances may influence the delivery of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems, however the magnitude of these effects compared to the natural background variability of DOC at the watershed scale is not well known. We measured DOC quantity, composition, and biodegradability from 14 river and stream reaches (watershed sizes ranging from 1.5\textendash{}167 km2) some of which were impacted by permafrost collapse (thermokarst) and fire. We found that region had a significant impact on quantity and biodegradability of DOC, likely driven by landscape and watershed characteristics such as lithology, soil and vegetation type, elevation, and glacial age. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that streams disturbed by thermokarst and fire did not contain significantly altered labile DOC fractions compared to adjacent reference waters, potentially due to rapid ecosystem recovery after fire and thermokarst as well as the limited spatial extent of thermokarst. Overall, biodegradable DOC ranged from 4 to 46 \% and contrary to patterns of DOC biodegradability in large Arctic rivers, seasonal variation in DOC biodegradability showed no clear pattern between sites, potentially related to stream geomorphology and position along the river network. While thermokarst and fire can alter DOC quantity and biodegradability at the scale of the feature, we conclude that tundra ecosystems are resilient to these types of disturbance.},

Using the known radar calibration accuracy, radar sensing depth is defined to help understand the limit of radar backscatter sensitivity to subsurface soil conditions and used as a consistency check when determining ALT. Retrieved maps of soil dielectric constants and layer thicknesses show high spatial correlation with the vegetation type and organic layer thickness.

We evaluated the potential for detecting dielectric changes within different soil layers using combined L- and P-band radar remote sensing as a prerequisite for detecting FT and moisture profile changes within the soil active layer. A two-layer scattering model was developed and validated for simulating radar responses from vertically inhomogeneous soil. The model simulations indicated that inhomogeneity in the soil dielectric profile contributes to both L- and P-band backscatter, but with greater P-band sensitivity at depth. The difference in L- and P-band responses to soil dielectric profile inhomogeneity appears suitable for detecting associated changes in soil active layer conditions. Additional evaluation using collocated airborne radar (AIRSAR) observations and in situ soil moisture measurements over alpine tundra indicates that combined L- and P-band SAR observations are sensitive to soil dielectric profile heterogeneity associated with variations in soil moisture and FT conditions.},

  abstract = {The Mackenzie Mountains were affected by montane valley glaciers during the Pleistocene and peripherally by the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glaciation. In this paper we report on magnetostratigraphic dating and correlation of three sections recording Late Pliocene to Late Pleistocene glaciations: Katherine Creek, Little Bear River, and Inlin Brook (located around 6S0N, 127"W). Each section consists of a colluvial unit overlying a Pliocene pediment surface cut into Proterozoic or Paleozoic bedrock, or Tertiary gravel, which is in turn overlain by a stack of five, and in places six, montane tills, usually with soils developed at their surfaces, and capped by a Laurentide till. Normal and reversed magnetizations were recognized with single-domain magnetite as a dominant remanence carrier. The Katherine Creek section has a normally magnetized colluvium at its base, which is overlain by two reversed tills, succeeded by three normal tills. We interpret the top two tills to be of Brunhes age ({$<$}780 ka) but argue that the lowermost normal till is of probable Olduvai age (ca. 1.8 Ma). The two underlying tills are of Matuyama age (2.6 Ma to 780 ka), and the colluvial base is assigned to the Gauss (3.5-2.6 Ma). The Little Bear River section exposes a stratigraphic record similar to that found at Katherine Creek. Only four units could be assigned a paleornagnetic polarity, the others yielding incoherent results. Paleosols on the first and second till units were reversed and normal, respectively, and the top till was normal. Thus there is clear evidence of an older (reversed) Pleistocene glaciation and a magnetostratigraphic record compatible with that found at Katherine Creek. Magnetic measurements from Inlin Brook gave largely incoherent results, with the exception of the surface (Laurentide) till, which is normal. The glacial history recorded in the Mackenzie Mountains correlates well with other studies carried out in the Cordillera. The large-scale changes in climate revealed in these terrestrial records provide baseline data for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.},

  isbn = {978-0-444-51592-6},
  abstract = {North-western Canada and eastern Alaska are recognised as having one of the oldest known continental glacial records (late Pliocene) preserved in stratigraphical sections. These include the individual and complex records of Cordilleran, montane and continental glaciations. Regional scale glaciations (Cordilleran and continental) started in northwestern Canada and east-central Alaska between 2.9 and 2.6 million years ago. Overall, two Cordilleran glaciations and two plateau ice caps (Horton Ice Cap) developed in the late Pliocene (Gauss and Matuyama Epochage). During the Early Pleistocene, three Cordilleran glaciations occurred, while one to five continental glaciations (Keewatin Ice Sheet and Horton Ice Cap?) are interpreted from the Banks Island stratigraphical record (late Matuyama Epoch). Three Middle Pleistocene glaciations are recorded for the Cordilleran (including the Reid Glaciation), as well as three continental (Keewatin Ice Sheet and Horton Ice Cap?) events (early Brunhes Epoch age). During the Late Pleistocene (late Brunhes) a well-defined, extensive continental ice sheet (Keewatin) covered western and northwestern Canada, while in the Yukon Cordillera and the Yukon-Tanana Uplands, two glaciations (early-Late Pleistocene Eagle Glaciation, and Late Pleistocene McConnell Glaciation) are recognised. Successive Cordilleran glaciations diminished in size, while continental glaciations increased. The moisture source for the Cordilleran ice was largely the Pacific Ocean, however, for the Horton Ice Cap, an open Arctic Ocean may have been a significant moisture source. The role of tectonics in the development of the two major physiographic barriers, the Wrangell/St Elias Mountains and the Continental Divide (Mackenzie/Selwyn Mountains) appears to have been an important controlling variable in moisture distribution in north-west Canada and east-central Alaska. The timing and interplay of tectonic uplift versus erosion of these barriers has very much controlled the growth, thickness and decay of ice masses in the interior of Yukon and valleys east of the continental divide.},

Reconstructing the role that these fluvial networks play in regional carbon (C) budgets requires identifying landscape and environmental drivers of riverine C that operate at the whole network scale and that can be applied across landscapes. Here we explore drivers of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic C (DIC) across 190 streams and rivers spanning 8 Strahler orders over an area of 500,000 km2 of heterogeneous boreal landscape in Qu\'ebec, focusing on those drivers that can be readily obtained from remote sensing data. Each C species (except DIC) could be modeled as a function of a proximal network-scale property, such as flow distance or elevation, but adding regional structure to these models greatly improved predictions. These modeled regional effects were similar for DOC, CO2, and CH4 and were strongly related to average regional soil organic content and especially to NPP, the latter integrating regional differences in climate and other environmental factors. These results suggest that there may be regional C baselines determined by a combination of landscape and climate features, which simultaneously influence the average CO2, DOC, and CH4 within fluvial networks, albeit through different underlying mechanisms and with varying degrees of influence on each C species. The latter two C species appear to be more sensitive to regional differences in soil, NPP, and climate than CO2 or DIC, and therefore more likely to shift under future scenarios of change in northern landscapes.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, sensors, and photogrammetric processing techniques have enabled timely and highly detailed three-dimensional surface reconstructions at a scale that bridges the gap between conventional remote-sensing and field-scale observations. In this work 29 rotary and fixed-wing UAV surveys were conducted during multiple field campaigns, totaling 47 flights and over 14.3 km2, to document permafrost thaw subsidence impacts on or close to road infrastructure in the Northwest Territories, Canada. This paper provides four case studies: (1) terrain models and orthomosaic time series revealed the morphology and daily to annual dynamics of thaw-driven mass wasting phenomenon (retrogressive thaw slumps; RTS). Scar zone cut volume estimates ranged between 3.2 \texttimes{} 103 and 5.9 \texttimes{} 106 m3. The annual net erosion of RTS surveyed ranged between 0.35 \texttimes{} 103 and 0.39 \texttimes{} 106 m3. The largest RTS produced a long debris tongue with an estimated volume of 1.9 \texttimes{} 106 m3. Downslope transport of scar zone and embankment fill materials was visualized using flow vectors, while thermal imaging revealed areas of exposed ground ice and mobile lobes of saturated, thawed materials. (2) Stratigraphic models were developed for RTS headwalls, delineating ground-ice bodies and stratigraphic unconformities. (3) In poorly drained areas along road embankments, UAV surveys detected seasonal terrain uplift and settlement of up to 0.5 m ({$>$}1700 m2 in extent) as a result of injection ice development. (4) Time series of terrain models highlighted the thaw-driven evolution of a borrow pit (6.4 \texttimes{} 105 m3 cut volume) constructed in permafrost terrain, whereby fluvial and thaw-driven sediment transfer (1.1 and 3.9 \texttimes{} 103 m3 a-1 respectively) was observed and whereby annual slope profile reconfiguration was monitored to gain management insights concerning site stabilization. Elevation model vertical accuracies were also assessed as part of the case studies and ranged between 0.02 and 0.13 m Root Mean Square Error, whereby photogrammetric models processed with Post-processed Kinematic image solutions achieved similar accuracies without ground control points over much larger and complex areas than previously reported. The high resolution of UAV surveys, and the capacity to derive quantitative time series provides novel insights into permafrost processes that are otherwise challenging to study. The timely emergence of these tools bridges field-based research and applied studies with broad-scale remote-sensing approaches during a period when climate change is transforming permafrost environments.},

  title = {Sources and Cycling of Dissolved Organic Carbon across a Landscape of Arctic Delta Lakes},
  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key regulator of aquatic ecosystems, and the primary substrate for aquatic bacteria. However, variations in function between different DOC sources are rarely studied. Arctic Mackenzie Delta lakes exhibit striking differences in DOC composition, with DOC sources ranging from C produced as a byproduct of aquatic plant (macrophyte) photosynthesis, to C derived from permafrost melting (thermokarst), and C delivered to lakes via river-water. This study assessed how variations in DOC source regulate the composition of the within-lake pool, drive bacterial metabolism and the contribution of bacterial biomass to higher trophic levels, and affect CO2 flux from Delta lakes. DOC-specific tracers showed macrophyte-derived DOC to comprise less than 15\% of the DOC pool in macrophyte-rich lakes, despite macrophyte C levels 7-12-fold greater than total DOC. However, bacterial {$\delta$}13C indicated that bacteria preferentially incorporate DOC generated by macrophytes, while surveys and incubation experiments showed that bacterial metabolism is rapid on macrophytic DOC, with high rates of bacterial biomass production relative to respiratory loss as CO2. Accordingly, {$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N, and fatty acid biomarkers demonstrated that zooplankton from macrophyte-rich lakes receive a greater proportion of their biomass from bacterial organic matter than zooplankton from other lake types. At the same time, however, experiments indicated that the high pH resulting from rapid photosynthesis in macrophyte-rich lakes can decrease the rate of bacterial metabolism over the short-term, and increase CO2 respiration at the expense of bacterial biomass production. In contrast, DOC-specific tracers indicated that thermokarst-derived DOC accumulates in lakes. Incubation experiments and in situ surveys revealed thermokarst DOC to be a relatively poor bacterial substrate, which resulted in proportionately more CO2 respiration, relative to bacterial biomass production, than observed for other Delta DOC sources. Moreover, multi-year surveys demonstrated that thermokarst lakes exhibit high levels of CO2 emission, despite clear undersaturation in other lakes, presumably because permafrost-derived DOC was largely respired by bacteria. Understanding the divergent roles played by the contrasting sources of DOC to Delta lakes both adds insight to the functioning of other lake regions, globally, and helps clarify the effect of climate-induced changes in DOC on northern lakes.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key parameter in lakes that can affect numerous features, including microbial metabolism, light climate, acidity, and primary production. In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes, we assembled a large database (7,514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes, the catchment, the soil, and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1\textendash{}332 mg L-1, and the median was 5.71 mg L-1. A partial least squares regression explained 48\% of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude, mean annual runoff, and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC, while conductivity, soil carbon density, and soil C:N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude, mean annual runoff, and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40\% of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment : lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set, these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes, where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region, and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake.},

Here, we present continuous-field cover maps for tundra plant functional types (PFTs) across \textasciitilde{}125,000 km2 of Alaska's North Slope at 30-m resolution. To develop maps, we collected a field-based training dataset using a point-intercept sampling method at 225 plots spanning bioclimatic and geomorphic gradients. We stratified vegetation by nine PFTs (e.g., low deciduous shrub, dwarf evergreen shrub, sedge, lichen) and summarized measurements of the PFTs, open water, bare ground and litter using the cover metrics total cover (areal cover including the understory) and top cover (uppermost canopy or ground cover). We then developed 73 spectral predictors derived from Landsat satellite observations (surface reflectance composites for \textasciitilde{}15-day periods from May\textendash{}August) and five gridded environmental predictors (e.g., summer temperature, climatological snow-free date) to model cover of PFTs using the random forest data-mining algorithm. Model performance tended to be best for canopy-forming PFTs, particularly deciduous shrubs. Our assessment of predictor importance indicated that models for low-statured PFTs were improved through the use of seasonal composites from early and late in the growing season, particularly when similar PFTs were aggregated together (e.g., total deciduous shrub, herbaceous). Continuous-field maps have many advantages over traditional thematic maps, and the methods described here are well-suited to support periodic map updates in tandem with future field and Landsat observations.},

The fascinating ice age history in this region has captured the imaginations of scientists, the Vuntut Gwitchin and the world for generations. Bluffs and banks along the Old Crow River are the richest source of ice age fossils in Canada. The Old Crow region also provides important clues about when the first people arrived in North America. In addition, layers of sediment and soil laid down over millions of years provide a crucial framework for the study of climate change in the Arctic. Scientific evidence from the Old Crow region provides many answers - and even more questions - about the long-vanished ice age world. ... An integral part of the story of ice age research in the Old Crow region is the continued involvement of the Vuntut Gwitchin. Since ancient times they have encountered the fossils of strange ancient beasts as they traversed the land and travelled the river. The importance of these ancient fossils is reflected in stories told by elders about how life as they know it came to be. Since the first arrival of scientists more than a century ago, the local people of Old Crow have provided valuable assistance and taken the time to share their stories and culture. With the signing of land claims and self-government agreements in 1993 the Vuntut Gwitchin gained greater responsibility for the management of ancient artifacts and fossils on their land. As a result, the Vuntut Gwitchin Government (VGG) owns and manages all fossils and artifacts found since 1995 on Vuntut Gwitchin Settlement Land. The creation of Vuntut National Park in 1995 further highlighted the importance of ice age research in the Old Crow region to the people of Canada."--ASTIS [online] database.},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {2196-632X},
  abstract = {Shorelines exhibit long-range dependence (LRD) and have been shown in some environments to be described in the wave number domain by a power-law characteristic of scale independence. Recent evidence suggests that the geomorphology of barrier islands can, however, exhibit scale dependence as a result of systematic variations in the underlying framework geology. The LRD of framework geology, which influences island geomorphology and its response to storms and sea level rise, has not been previously examined. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys conducted along Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS), Texas, United States, reveal that the EMI apparent conductivity ({$\sigma$}a) signal and, by inference, the framework geology exhibits LRD at scales of up to 101 to 102 km. Our study demonstrates the utility of describing EMI {$\sigma$}a and lidar spatial series by a fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process that specifically models LRD. This method offers a robust and compact way of quantifying the geological variations along a barrier island shoreline using three statistical parameters (p, d, q). We discuss how ARIMA models that use a single parameter d provide a quantitative measure for determining free and forced barrier island evolutionary behavior across different scales. Statistical analyses at regional, intermediate, and local scales suggest that the geologic framework within an area of paleo-channels exhibits a first-order control on dune height. The exchange of sediment amongst nearshore, beach, and dune in areas outside this region are scale independent, implying that barrier islands like PAIS exhibit a combination of free and forced behaviors that affect the response of the island to sea level rise.},

Differences in seasonal timing of river temperatures were evident when comparing the coldest and warmest years of the study period, and across different discharge conditions. Snowmelt runoff is characterized by uniformly cold water ({$\sim$}0\textendash{}1 \textdegree{}C) over a wide range of discharge conditions, followed by warming water temperatures during flow recession. The rivers showed varying sensitivity to mid-summer air temperature conditions in a given year, with warmer years indicating high correlation (r2 = 0.794\textendash{}0.929), whereas colder years showed reduced correlation (r2 = 0.368\textendash{}0.778). River temperatures reached levels which are reported to negatively affect fish and other cold-water aquatic species ({$>$}18 \textdegree{}C) with greater frequency and duration during the warmest years.

  abstract = {Over the next century, near-surface permafrost across the circumpolar Arctic is expected to degrade significantly, particularly for land areas south of 70\textdegree{}N. This is likely to cause widespread impacts on arctic hydrology, ecology, and trace gas emissions. Here, we present a review of recent studies investigating linkages between permafrost dynamics and river biogeochemistry in the Arctic, including consideration of likely impacts that warming-induced changes in permafrost may be having (or will have in the future) on the delivery of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions to the Arctic Ocean. These interacting processes can be highly complex and undoubtedly exhibit spatial and temporal variabilities associated with current permafrost conditions, sensitivity to permafrost thaw, mode of permafrost degradation (overall permafrost thaw, active layer deepening, and/or thermokarst processes), and environmental characteristics of watersheds (e.g. land cover, soil type, and topography). One of the most profound consequences of permafrost thaw projected for the future is that the arctic terrestrial freshwater system is likely to experience a transition from a surface water-dominated system to a groundwater-dominated system. Along with many other cascading impacts from this transition, mineral-rich groundwater may become an important contributor to streamflow, in addition to the currently dominant contribution from mineral-poor surface water. Most studies observe or predict an increase in major ion, phosphate, and silicate export with this shift towards greater groundwater contributions. However, we see conflicting accounts of whether the delivery of inorganic nitrogen and organic matter will increase or decrease with warming and permafrost thaw. It is important to note that uncertainties in the predictions of the total flux of biogeochemical constituents are tightly linked to future uncertainties in discharge of rivers. Nonetheless, it is clear that over the next century there will be important shifts in the river transport of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions, which may in turn have critical implications for primary production and carbon cycling on arctic shelves and in the Arctic Ocean basin interior.

  abstract = {The fate of carbon (C) contained within permafrost in boreal forest environments is an important consideration for the current and future carbon cycle as soils warm in northern latitudes. Currently, little is known about the microbiology or chemistry of permafrost soils that may affect its decomposition once soils thaw. We tested the hypothesis that low microbial abundances and activities in permafrost soils limit decomposition rates compared with active layer soils. We examined active layer and permafrost soils near Fairbanks, AK, the Yukon River, and the Arctic Circle. Soils were incubated in the lab under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Gas fluxes at -5 and 5 \textdegree{}C were measured to calculate temperature response quotients (Q10). The Q10 was lower in permafrost soils (average 2.7) compared with active layer soils (average 7.5). Soil nutrients, leachable dissolved organic C (DOC) quality and quantity, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the soils revealed that the organic matter within permafrost soils is as labile, or even more so, than surface soils. Microbial abundances (fungi, bacteria, and subgroups: methanogens and Basidiomycetes) and exoenzyme activities involved in decomposition were lower in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, which, together with the chemical data, supports the reduced Q10 values. CH4 fluxes were correlated with methanogen abundance and the highest CH4 production came from active layer soils. These results suggest that permafrost soils have high inherent decomposability, but low microbial abundances and activities reduce the temperature sensitivity of C fluxes. Despite these inherent limitations, however, respiration per unit soil C was higher in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, suggesting that decomposition and heterotrophic respiration may contribute to a positive feedback to warming of this eco region.},

  abstract = {This synthesis addresses the vulnerability of the North American high-latitude soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to climate change. Disturbances caused by climate warming in arctic, subarctic, and boreal environments can result in significant redistribution of C among major reservoirs with potential global impacts. We divide the current northern high-latitude SOC pools into (1) near-surface soils where SOC is affected by seasonal freeze-thaw processes and changes in moisture status, and (2) deeper permafrost and peatland strata down to several tens of meters depth where SOC is usually not affected by short-term changes. We address key factors (permafrost, vegetation, hydrology, paleoenvironmental history) and processes (C input, storage, decomposition, and output) responsible for the formation of the large high-latitude SOC pool in North America and highlight how climate-related disturbances could alter this pool's character and size. Press disturbances of relatively slow but persistent nature such as top-down thawing of permafrost, and changes in hydrology, microbiological communities, pedological processes, and vegetation types, as well as pulse disturbances of relatively rapid and local nature such as wildfires and thermokarst, could substantially impact SOC stocks. Ongoing climate warming in the North American high-latitude region could result in crossing environmental thresholds, thereby accelerating press disturbances and increasingly triggering pulse disturbances and eventually affecting the C source/sink net character of northern high-latitude soils. Finally, we assess postdisturbance feedbacks, models, and predictions for the northern high-latitude SOC pool, and discuss data and research gaps to be addressed by future research.},

  abstract = {The permafrost monitoring network in the polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere was enhanced during the International Polar Year (IPY), and new information on permafrost thermal state was collected for regions where there was little available. This augmented monitoring network is an important legacy of the IPY, as is the updated baseline of current permafrost conditions against which future changes may be measured. Within the Northern Hemisphere polar region, ground temperatures are currently being measured in about 575 boreholes in North America, the Nordic region and Russia. These show that in the discontinuous permafrost zone, permafrost temperatures fall within a narrow range, with the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at most sites being higher than \`A28C. A greater range in MAGT is present within the continuous permafrost zone, from above \`A18C at some locations to as low as \`A158C. The latest results indicate that the permafrost warming which started two to three decades ago has generally continued into the IPY period. Warming rates are much smaller for permafrost already at temperatures close to 08C compared with colder permafrost, especially for ice-rich permafrost where latent heat effects dominate the ground thermal regime. Colder permafrost sites are warming more rapidly. This improved knowledge about the permafrost thermal state and its dynamics is important for multidisciplinary polar research, but also for many of the 4 million people living in the Arctic. In particular, this knowledge is required for designing effective adaptation strategies for the local communities under warmer climatic conditions. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Degrading permafrost can alter ecosystems, damage infrastructure, and release enough carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to influence global climate. The permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) is the amplification of surface warming due to CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost. An analysis of available estimates PCF strength and timing indicate 120 {$\pm$} 85 Gt of carbon emissions from thawing permafrost by 2100. This is equivalent to 5.7 {$\pm$} 4.0\% of total anthropogenic emissions for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and would increase global temperatures by 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.21 \textdegree{}C or 7.8 {$\pm$} 5.7\%. For RCP4.5, the scenario closest to the 2 \textdegree{}C warming target for the climate change treaty, the range of cumulative emissions in 2100 from thawing permafrost decreases to between 27 and 100 Gt C with temperature increases between 0.05 and 0.15 \textdegree{}C, but the relative fraction of permafrost to total emissions increases to between 3\% and 11\%. Any substantial warming results in a committed, long-term carbon release from thawing permafrost with 60\% of emissions occurring after 2100, indicating that not accounting for permafrost emissions risks overshooting the 2 \textdegree{}C warming target. Climate projections in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and any emissions targets based on those projections, do not adequately account for emissions from thawing permafrost and the effects of the PCF on global climate. We recommend the IPCC commission a special assessment focusing on the PCF and its impact on global climate to supplement the AR5 in support of treaty negotiation.},

  abstract = {Permafrost thaw in peatlands has the potential to alter catchment export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and thus influence downstream aquatic C cycling. Subarctic peatlands are often mosaics of different peatland types, where permafrost conditions regulate the hydrological setting of each type. We show that hydrological setting is key to observed differences in magnitude, timing, and chemical composition of DOC export between permafrost and nonpermafrost peatland types, and that these differences influence the export of DOC of larger catchments even when peatlands are minor catchment components. In many aspects, DOC export from a studied peatland permafrost plateau was similar to that of a forested upland catchment. Similarities included low annual export (2\textendash{}3 g C m\`A2) dominated by the snow melt period (\textasciitilde{}70\%), and how substantial DOC export following storms required wet antecedent conditions. Conversely, nonpermafrost fens had higher DOC export (7 g C m\`A2), resulting from sustained hydrological connectivity during summer. Chemical composition of catchment DOC export arose from the mixing of highly aromatic DOC from organic soils from permafrost plateau soil water and upland forest surface horizons with nonaromatic DOC from mineral soil groundwater, but was further modulated by fens. Increasing aromaticity from fen inflow to outlet was substantial and depended on both water residence time and water temperature. The role of fens as catchment biogeochemical hotspots was further emphasized by their capacity for sulfate retention. As a result of fen characteristics, a 4\% fen cover in a mixed catchment was responsible for 34\% higher DOC export, 50\% higher DOC concentrations and \textasciitilde{}10\% higher DOC aromaticity at the catchment outlet during summer compared to a nonpeatland upland catchment. Expansion of fens due to thaw thus has potential to influence landscape C cycling by increasing fen capacity to act as biogeochemical hotspots, amplifying aquatic C cycling, and increasing catchment DOC export.},

  volume = {23},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {In the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, boreal forest carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes will be altered directly by climate change through changing meteorological forcing and indirectly through changes in landscape functioning associated with thaw-induced collapse-scar bog (`wetland') expansion. However, their combined effect on landscape-scale net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEELAND), resulting from changing gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), remains unknown. Here, we quantify indirect land cover change impacts on NEELAND and direct climate change impacts on modeled temperature- and light-limited NEELAND of a boreal forest\textendash{}wetland landscape. Using nested eddy covariance flux towers, we find both GPP and ER to be larger at the landscape compared to the wetland level. However, annual NEELAND (\`A20 g C m\`A2) and wetland NEE (\`A24 g C m\`A2) were similar, suggesting negligible wetland expansion effects on NEELAND. In contrast, we find non-negligible direct climate change impacts when modeling NEELAND using projected air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. At the end of the 21st century, modeled GPP mainly increases in spring and fall due to reduced temperature limitation, but becomes more frequently light-limited in fall. In a warmer climate, ER increases year-round in the absence of moisture stress resulting in net CO2 uptake increases in the shoulder seasons and decreases during the summer. Annually, landscape net CO2 uptake is projected to decline by 25 \AE{} 14 g C m\`A2 for a moderate and 103 \AE{} 38 g C m\`A2 for a high warming scenario, potentially reversing recently observed positive net CO2 uptake trends across the boreal biome. Thus, even without moisture stress, net CO2 uptake of boreal forest\textendash{}wetland landscapes may decline, and ultimately, these landscapes may turn into net CO2 sources under continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We conclude that NEELAND changes are more likely to be driven by direct climate change rather than by indirect land cover change impacts.},

This study investigates hydrological carbon transport through the subsurface to streams and how it is affected by the distribution of subsurface hydrological pathways and travel times through the landscape. We develop a consistent mechanistic, pathway- and travel time-based modeling approach for release and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The model implications are tested against observations in the subarctic Abiskojokken catchment in northernmost Sweden (68{$\smwhtcircle$}21 N, 18{$\smwhtcircle$}49 E) as a field case example of a discontinuous permafrost region. The results show: (a) For DOC, both concentration and load are essentially flow-independent because their dynamics are instead dominated by the annual renewal and depletion. Specifically, the flow independence is the result of the small characteristic DOC respiration-dissolution time scale, in the range of 1 yr, relative to the average travel time of water through the subsurface to the stream. (b) For DIC, the load is highly flow-dependent due to the large characteristic weatheringdissolution time, much larger than 1 yr, relative to the average subsurface water travel time to the stream. This rate relation keeps the DIC concentration essentially flow-independent, and thereby less fluctuating in time than the DIC load.},

  abstract = {Permafrost peatlands store one-third of the total carbon (C) in the atmosphere and are increasingly vulnerable to thaw as high-latitude temperatures warm. Large uncertainties remain about C dynamics following permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands. We used a chronosequence approach to measure C stocks in forested permafrost plateaus (forest) and thawed permafrost bogs, ranging in thaw age from young ({$<$}10 years) to old ({$>$}100 years) from two interior Alaska chronosequences. Permafrost originally aggraded simultaneously with peat accumulation (syngenetic permafrost) at both sites. We found that upon thaw, C loss of the forest peat C is equivalent to \textasciitilde{}30\% of the initial forest C stock and is directly proportional to the prethaw C stocks. Our model results indicate that permafrost thaw turned these peatlands into net C sources to the atmosphere for a decade following thaw, after which post-thaw bog peat accumulation returned sites to net C sinks. It can take multiple centuries to millennia for a site to recover its prethaw C stocks; the amount of time needed for them to regain their prethaw C stocks is governed by the amount of C that accumulated prior to thaw. Consequently, these findings show that older peatlands will take longer to recover prethaw C stocks, whereas younger peatlands will exceed prethaw stocks in a matter of centuries. We conclude that the loss of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost by 2100 could result in a loss of up to 24 Pg of deep C from permafrost peatlands.},

The model incorporates the influence of active layer dynamics and slope aspect on hydrological flowpaths and resulting DOC mobilization. Calibration and evaluation of the model was undertaken using observations from Granger Basin within the Wolf Creek research basin, Yukon, northern Canada. Results show that the model was able to capture the dominant hydrological response and DOC dynamics of the catchment reasonably well. Simulated DOC was highly correlated with observed DOC (r2 = 0.65) for the study period. During the snowmelt period, the model adequately captured the observed dynamics, with simulations generally reflecting the timing and magnitude of the observed DOC and stream discharge. The model was less successful over the later summer period although this partly reflected a lack of DOC observations for calibration. The developed model offers a valuable framework for investigating the interactions between hydrological and DOC processes in these highly dynamic systems, where data acquisition is often very difficult. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors Hydrological Processes Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Lakes of the Mackenzie Delta occur across a gradient that contains three clear end members: those that remain connected to river-water channels throughout the summer; those that receive only brief inputs of river water during an annual spring flood but contain dense macrophyte stands; and those that experience significant permafrost thaw along their margins. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption and fluorescence, and stable isotopes of DOM, DOM precursor materials, and bacteria to elucidate the importance of river water, macrophytes, and thermokarst as DOM sources to Mackenzie Delta lakes. Despite standing stocks of macrophyte C that are sevenfold to 12-fold greater than those of total DOC, stable isotopes indicated that autochthonous sources contributed less than 15\% to overall DOM in macrophyte-rich lakes. Instead, fluorescence and absorption indicated that the moderate summertime increase in DOC concentration in macrophyte-rich lakes was the result of infrequent flushing, while bacterial d13C indicated rapid bacterial removal of autochthonous DOC from the water column. In thermokarst lakes, summertime increases in DOC concentration were substantial, and stable isotopes indicated that much of this increase came from C released as a result of thermokarst-related processes. Our results indicate that these distinct sources of DOM to neighboring arctic Delta lakes may drive between-lake differences in C cycling and energy flow. Rapidly assimilated macrophyte DOM should be an important contributor to microbial food webs in our study lakes. In contrast, the accumulation of thermokarst-origin DOM allows for a significant role in physico-chemistry but indicates a lesser contribution of this DOM to higher trophic levels.},

  volume = {23},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {Rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic might cause a greater release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. To study the effect of warming on GHG dynamics, we deployed open-top chambers in a subarctic tundra site in Northeast European Russia. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the concentration of those gases, inorganic nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the soil profile. Studied tundra surfaces ranged from mineral to organic soils and from vegetated to unvegetated areas. As a result of air warming, the seasonal GHG budget of the vegetated tundra surfaces shifted from a GHG sink of \`A300 to \`A198 g CO2\textendash{}eq m\`A2 to a source of 105 to 144 g CO2\textendash{}eq m\`A2. At bare peat surfaces, we observed increased release of all three GHGs. While the positive warming response was dominated by CO2, we provide here the first in situ evidence of increasing N2O emissions from tundra soils with warming. Warming promoted N2O release not only from bare peat, previously identified as a strong N2O source, but also from the abundant, vegetated peat surfaces that do not emit N2O under present climate. At these surfaces, elevated temperatures had an adverse effect on plant growth, resulting in lower plant N uptake and, consequently, better N availability for soil microbes. Although the warming was limited to the soil surface and did not alter thaw depth, it increased concentrations of DOC, CO2, and CH4 in the soil down to the permafrost table. This can be attributed to downward DOC leaching, fueling microbial activity at depth. Taken together, our results emphasize the tight linkages between plant and soil processes, and different soil layers, which need to be taken into account when predicting the climate change feedback of the Arctic.},

We focus on the key error sources associated with solar angle, weather conditions, geolocation, and radiometric calibration and estimate their relative contributions that can lead to uncertainty of more than {$\pm$}10\% in peak season NDVI estimates of our tundra field site. Our findings show that these errors can be accounted for by improved flight planning, metadata collection, ground control point deployment, use of reflectance targets, and quality control. With standardized best practice, multispectral sensors can provide meaningful spatial data that is reproducible and comparable across space and time.},

Low shrub and graminoid tundra contributed preferentially to the greening trend, while forested areas were less likely to show significant trends in NDVI. These trends reflect increasing leaf area, rather than an increase in growing season length, because Landsat data were restricted to peak-summer conditions. The average NDVI trend (0.007 yr\`A1) corresponds to a leaf-area index (LAI) increase of \textasciitilde{}0.6 based on the regional relationship between LAI and NDVI from the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer. Across the entire transect, the area-averaged LAI increase was \textasciitilde{}0.2 during 1986\textendash{}2010. A higher area-averaged LAI change (\textasciitilde{}0.3) within the shrub-tundra portion of the transect represents a 20\textendash{}60\% relative increase in LAI during the last two decades. Our Landsat-based analysis subdivides the overall high-latitude greening trend into changes in peak-summer greenness by cover type. Different responses within and among shrub, graminoid, and tree-dominated cover types in this study indicate important fine-scale heterogeneity in vegetation growth. Although our findings are consistent with community shifts in low-biomass vegetation types over multi-decadal time scales, the response in tundra and forest ecosystems to recent warming was not uniform.},

  abstract = {An isolated, eroding pingo at the southern end of Parry Peninsula, N.W.T., Canada was first photographed in about 1910. The photograph allows examination of a century of landform change. Since 1910, the pingo crater pond has drained, the north side of the pingo has become well vegetated, the serrated crest has been smoothed, and the lake bottom has become colonised by willows and other vegetation. The height of the feature was over 100 ft (30 m) in 1910 and is now about 50 ft (15\textendash{}17 m). The erosion of the pingo has probably been dominated by the strong southerly katabatic winds in the area, as the vegetation on the south side of the pingo is poorly developed in comparison with the north side. A secondary cause of erosion has been the numerous excavations by ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and foxes (Vulpes lagopus) on the slopes of the pingo. It is unusual to detect change of collapsed pingos near the western Arctic coast of Canada unless ground ice is exposed in the core or on the sides of the pingo. The increases since 1996 in height and cover of willows are the first record of such change from western Arctic Canada. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In arctic Alaska, air temperatures have warmed 0.5 degrees Celsius (\r{}C) per decade for the past 30 years, with most of the warming coming in winter. Over the same period, shrub abundance has increased, perhaps a harbinger of a conversion of tundra to shrubland. Evidence suggests that winter biological processes are contributing to this conversion through a positive feedback that involves the snow-holding capacity of shrubs, the insulating properties of snow, a soil layer that has a high water content because it overlies nearly impermeable permafrost, and hardy microbes that can maintain metabolic activity at temperatures of \textendash{}6\r{}C or lower. Increasing shrub abundance leads to deeper snow, which promotes higher winter soil temperatures, greater microbial activity, and more plant-available nitrogen. High levels of soil nitrogen favor shrub growth the following summer. With climate models predicting continued warming, large areas of tundra could become converted to shrubland, with winter processes like those described here possibly playing a critical role.},

Processing the raw data in individual flightlines maintained the high relative accuracy of the data set and allowed for the detection of sub-meter vegetation. First return LiDAR pulse data were used to both determine the ground surface as well as calculate vegetation heights. Surface roughness maps based on vegetation heights were found to best capture the variability of the canopy and accurately distinguish burned and unburned areas. Field validation of a sagebrush presence and absence classification based on a single roughness threshold value indicates an overall accuracy of 86\%. The LiDAR-determined vegetation heights are moderately well correlated to those measured in the field, although the LiDAR heights uniformly underestimate the field heights. This underestimation is believed to be due to signal threshold limits within the LiDAR sensor, producing heights corresponding to the interior of the shrub canopy rather than the top.},

  title = {Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Leaf Area of Low-Stature {{Arctic}} Shrubs with Terrestrial {{LiDAR}}},
  volume = {164},
  issn = {00344257},
  abstract = {Arctic tundra ecosystems are responding to effects of climatic warming via shifts in vegetation composition and increased woody biomass. In this sensitive ecosystem, minor increases in woody plant biomass may induce significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. However, establishing methods for quantifying and potentially scaling woody plant biomass in low-stature biomes is challenging. In this study, we investigated the potential to use terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to remotely estimate harvested biomass and leaf area of two dominant low-stature (b1.5 m tall) Arctic shrub species in 0.64 m2 subplots established in northern Alaskan tundra. We explored two biomass estimation approaches (volumetric surface differencing and voxel counting) applied to point clouds obtained from close-range (2 m) and variable-range (b50 m) terrestrial laser scans. Relationships between harvested biomass and TLS metrics were strong for all combinations of approaches, with voxel counting giving a marginally better result than surface differencing for close-range data (R2 = 0.94 vs 0.92; RMSE = 102 g vs 117 g) and surface differencing proving stronger than voxel counting for variable-range data (R2 = 0.91 vs 0.82; RMSE = 119 g vs 169 g). Strong relationships between total harvested biomass and total leaf dry mass (R2 = 0.93; RMSE = 13.4 g), and between leaf dry mass and leaf wet area (R2 = 0.99; RMSE = 9.01 cm2) justify estimation of shrub leaf area from TLS-derived shrub biomass. Our results show that rapidly acquired, repeatable terrestrial laser scans taken at multiple ranges can be processed using simple biomass estimation approaches to yield aboveground biomass and leaf area estimates for low-stature shrubs at fine spatial scales (sub-meter to \textasciitilde{}50 meters) with the fidelity required to monitor small but ecologically meaningful changes in tundra structure. Further, these data may be employed as ground reference data for broader scale remote sensing data collection, such as airborne LiDAR scanning, that would enable shrub biomass and leaf-area estimates at fine spatial resolution over large spatial extents.},

  abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spectral imaging offers considerable advantages in high-resolution remote-sensing applications. However, the number of sensors mountable on a UAV is limited, and selecting the optimal combination of spectral bands is complex but crucial for conventional UAV-based multispectral imaging systems. To overcome these limitations, we adopted a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF), which can transmit selected wavelengths without the need to exchange optical filters. For calibration and validation of the LCTF-based hyperspectral imaging system, a field campaign was conducted in the Philippines during March 28\textendash{}April 3, 2016. In this campaign, UAV-based hyperspectral imaging was performed in several vegetated areas, and the spectral reflectances of 14 different ground objects were measured. Additionally, the machine learning (ML) approach using a support vector machine (SVM) model was applied to the obtained dataset, and a highresolution classification map was then produced from the aerial hyperspectral images. The results clearly showed that a large amount of misclassification occurred in shaded areas due to the difference in spectral reflectance between sunlit and shaded areas. It was also found that the classification accuracy was drastically improved by training the SVM model with both sunlit and shaded spectral data. As a result, we achieved a classification accuracy of 94.5\% in vegetated areas.},

Because this class is generally less expensive and more versatile than larger systems the use of small UASs for civil, commercial, and scientific applications is expected to expand considerably in the future. To highlight different environmental applications, we provide an overview of recent progress in remote sensing with small UASs, including photogrammetry, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, thermal, and synthetic aperture radar and LiDAR. We also draw on the literature and our own research experience to identify some key research challenges, including limitations of the current generation of platforms and sensors, and the development of optimal methodologies for processing and analysis. While much of the potential of small UASs for remote sensing remains to be realised, it is likely that the next few years will see such systems being used to provide data for an ever-increasing range of environmental applications.},
