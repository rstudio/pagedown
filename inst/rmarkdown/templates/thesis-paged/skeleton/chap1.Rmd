# The Basics {.chapter}

## Introduction

This template is based on the `pagedown::html_paged` template and modified to meet the requirements of a generic thesis document. Standard RMarkdown formatting can be used for smooth and distraction free writting, for example I will add a citation for the {knitr} package which is located in the `Thesis.bib` file auto-generated in this template [@knitr2014].

Thanks to the [help](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/101) of [Romain Lesur](https://github.com/RLesur) this template has the ability to tag section headers with the word "Chapter ". To have your chapters display as this one (_Chapter 1 The Basics_) use the `{.chapter}` class like this:

_**rmarkdown**_
```markdown
---
output:
  pagedown::thesis_paged
    number_Sections: yes
---
# The Basics {.chapter}

## Introduction

## Second level heading

Here is some code and a plot, with a figure caption, Figure \@ref(fig:code):

```{r code, fig.cap='The automatic numbering of this figure will only work if it includes a figure caption, user beware!'}

plot(iris$Sepal.Length,
     iris$Sepal.Width,
     col=iris$Species, pch=19)
```

Here is an example of an abbreviation where I use the `<abbr>` html tag <abbr title="Brent Thorne">BT</abbr>. In the future there may be a pandoc solution to abbreviation management, however <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the way to go for now.
