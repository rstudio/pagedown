# The Basics {.chapter}

## Introduction

This template is based on the `pagedown::html_paged` template and modified to meet the requirements of a generic thesis document. Standard RMarkdown formatting can be used for smooth and distraction free writting, for example I will add a citation for the {knitr} package which is located in the `Thesis.bib` file auto-generated in this template [@knitr2014].

## Second level heading

Here is some code and a plot, with a figure caption, Figure \@ref(fig:code):

```{r code, fig.cap='The automatic numbering of this figure will only work if it includes a figure caption, user beware!'}

plot(iris$Sepal.Length,
     iris$Sepal.Width,
     col=iris$Species, pch=19)
```
