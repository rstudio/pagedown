# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

You can use markdown or $\LaTeX$ commands:

* [Java]{.proglang} or $\proglang{Java}$ 
* [plyr]{.pkg} or $\pkg{plyr}$
* `print("abc")` or $\code{print("abc")}$

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
